# E-Certificate-Validation
E-Certificate Validation using Keccak-256 and ECDSA in Blockchain

## Algorithm Used:
- Keccak-256 (original keccak-256 before adapted into SHA-3 Family)
- Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm

## Blockchain distributed e-certificate storage
This will be using Ethereum Blockchain for storing e-certificate data and its sign. 
The will also provide smart contract that have been coded using solidity language
This will also provide code for deploying the contract into local Blockchain (using Ganache for current development).
The ABI and Contract bytecode provided for archieve, I do recommend user to made their own ABI and bytecode using Remix
